## Level 3, Task 11: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

This task was an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The purpose was to take assorted garden path sentences, *[a grammatically correct sentence that starts in such a way that a reader's most likely 
interpretation will be incorrect; the reader is lured into a parse that turns out to be a dead end or yields a clearly unintended meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence)*, 
and see how a Python NLP library with the English language model can cope with them.

The library chosen was [spaCy](https://spacy.io).
